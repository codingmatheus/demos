# Python Collections Cheatsheet

This project contains code snippets for Python beginners to understand the different types of collections available in Python. Here's a summary of the collections covered:

## 1. Lists (lists.py)

- Ordered, mutable collections
- Can contain mixed data types
- Defined using square brackets `[]`
- Supports indexing, slicing, and various methods for manipulation

## 2. Tuples (tuples.py)

- Ordered, immutable collections
- Can contain mixed data types
- Defined using parentheses `()`
- Useful for storing fixed collections of data

## 3. Sets (sets.py)

- Unordered collections of unique elements
- Mutable (can add or remove elements)
- Defined using curly braces `{}`
- Supports set operations like union, intersection, etc.

## 4. Dictionaries (dictionaries.py)

- Unordered collections of key-value pairs
- Mutable (can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs)
- Defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs
- Efficient for lookups and associating data

Each file in this project demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and common operations for its respective collection type. This cheatsheet serves as a quick reference for understanding the characteristics and usage of these fundamental Python data structures.
